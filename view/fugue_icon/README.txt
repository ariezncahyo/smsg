Icons created by Yusuke Kamiyamane <http://www.pinvoke.com/>.  Adapted by

This package contains a Claws Mail icon theme made up entirely of PNG icons. 
YOU NEED CLAWS MAIL VERSION 3.4.0 OR LATER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS.

The icons in this package have been originally created by Kamiyamane-san,
published as Fugue version 2.2.2 and Diagona 1.0, and are covered by a
Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.  Please see the file LICENSE.txt
for further details.  You are not obliged to agree to the terms of said
license, however, nothing else gives you the right to use these icons.

The package contains icons that vaguely resemble logos of Adobe products. 
They are a loose imitation of the originals, created from scratch.  It is
neither mine nor Kamiyamane-san's intention to infringe upon trademarks
owned by Adobe nor to create any confusion regarding their products, but
simply to provide means of loosely identifying certain types of mail
attachments.
